## Local snapshot (fleet scheme, NOTEBOOK_SPEC 1.1 ST3/ST4)

The pinned snapshot lives in `weights/tabicl-regressor-v2/` (the `MODEL_KEY`). The committed
`dimer-base-manifest.json` there lists the checkpoint's path, byte size and SHA-256 and is the parity anchor the
standalone tutorials carry inline; the checkpoint itself is git-ignored (`weights/**/*.ckpt`). `verify_snapshot`
re-hashes every manifest entry and asserts the manifest digest equals the package's `BASE_MODEL_SHA256`;
`stage_missing_files(allow_download=True)` fetches only the entries that are absent, from the Hub at the immutable
revision; `TabICLRegressionPipeline.from_pretrained(weights_dir=...)` runs both before constructing the estimator on
the verified file (`allow_auto_download=False`). To use an offline copy, place the `.ckpt` in that directory before
running — nothing is downloaded when every manifest entry is present and verified.

```bash
# Stage the pinned checkpoint through the package helpers (fetches only what is absent):
python -c "from tabicl_regressor_pipeline import stage_missing_files, verify_snapshot; print(stage_missing_files(allow_download=True)); print(verify_snapshot()['files'])"
```

The checkpoint is a Lightning/PyTorch `.ckpt` deserialised by `tabicl`; the digest check establishes byte integrity
against this repository's pinned identity, not producer authenticity or model quality. The DIMER fine-tuner image bakes
the same file at build time (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`).
