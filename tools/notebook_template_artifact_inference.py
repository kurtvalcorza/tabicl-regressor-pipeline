        "expanded-size checks, verifies the manifest's payload allowlist, sizes and SHA-256 digests, validates the "
        "artifact/runtime provenance, rebuilds the in-context regressor from the bundle alone (bundled checkpoint + "
        "training context + recorded inference settings), accepts genuinely new unlabelled rows, predicts continuous "
        "point estimates, and exports results. **No artifact is created here** and no gradient step runs.\n\n"
        "**Trust boundary.** Digest and manifest checks establish internal consistency, not sender authenticity, and "
        "the bundled `checkpoints/best.ckpt` is deserialised by `tabicl` (a Lightning/PyTorch checkpoint) — you are "
        "trusting the producer of the ZIP. The pinned base checkpoint of Section 3 is acquired and digest-verified "
        "independently so the manifest's `baseModelSha256` can be checked against a known-good value. Use only bundles "
