"""Companion template for tools/build_notebook.py /3 — ARTIFACT-INFERENCE (NOTEBOOK_SPEC 2.2 §19, §25.13).

Generate with ``python tools/build_notebook.py --template tools/notebook_template_artifact_inference.py``. The notebook
carries the same package and pinned checkpoint manifest as the E2E notebook, its own stage runner
(``tools/tutorial_stages_artifact_inference.py``) and the pinned sample bundle of ``examples/sample-bundle/`` (manifest,
support table, eight unlabelled rows; its checkpoint is the pinned base checkpoint staged in Section 3). A user bundle
ZIP (``ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH`` or an upload) is checked against ``EXPECTED_ZIP_SHA256``. The notebook never creates a bundle.

        "A successful run proves that the bundle passed the package's path, symlink and expanded-size checks, that its payload "
        "matches the manifest's allowlist, sizes and digests, that it names the pinned base checkpoint — and, for a `pretrained` "
        "bundle, that its checkpoint is byte for byte that base — that the runtime is compatible with the producer's, that an "
        "in-context regressor was rebuilt from the bundle alone, and that schema- and type-compatible new rows were scored "
        "with continuous point predictions — without the "
        "repository being reachable. It does **not** authenticate the producer beyond the channel a trusted digest came "
        "through, or establish predictive quality, robustness, uncertainty, fairness, or production fitness; the evaluation "
        "report says `not-measurable` because no labels exist here, and the exported point predictions carry no interval "
        "that would justify a tolerance decision without the caller's own labelled data. Never bypass a failed archive, manifest, digest, base-model or schema "
        "check; obtain a correct trusted bundle. The pinned sample bundle was built offline by `tools/build_sample_bundle.py` "
        "(no model run; `metrics: null`); its support table is cross-checked against a real E2E export by "
        "`matches_pinned_sample_context`.\n\n"
        "Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision's package, carried in this notebook, can "
        "acquire and digest-verify the pinned checkpoint, validate and reconstruct an external bundle, validate the "
        "supplied inference table, execute the public prediction path and emit the shown machine-readable outputs in the "
        "tested runtime. It does **not** establish benchmark superiority, deployment calibration, safety for "
        "high-consequence decisions, or production fitness on an unseen domain.\n\n"
        "## Conclusion · [Evaluation practice]\n\n"
        "Write three sentences: what the digest checks and the base binding established about the bundle you used; what the "
        "rebuild and the eight predictions show; and what you would need before trusting these predictions for a decision.\n\n"
        "<details>\n<summary>Sample conclusion (open after writing yours)</summary>\n\n"
        "The pinned sample bundle's manifest matched its recorded SHA-256, and because it declares `mode: pretrained` its "
        "checkpoint had to be — and was — the base checkpoint verified in Section 3, so every file I loaded is pinned. The "
        "regressor was rebuilt from the bundle's own support rows and settings and scored eight unseen rows with point "
        "predictions; with no labels the report is correctly `not-measurable`. Before using these predictions for a decision "
        "I would need a labelled, domain-representative test set and an uncertainty estimate to set a tolerance.\n\n"
        "</details>\n\n"
        "**Next experiments:** run the E2E notebook, then set `ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH` to its "
        "`outputs/tabiclv2_regressor_artifact.zip`, paste its printed digest into `EXPECTED_ZIP_SHA256`, and score its "
        "`outputs/tabiclv2_regressor_new_rows.csv` through `NEW_DATA_PATH`; paste a digest with one character changed and read "
        "the refusal; compare predictions from a pretrained and a fine-tuned bundle of the same split.\n\n"
